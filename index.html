<br> a game with dynamic sound that make you recall watching a tennis match<br>
<br> when the ball on pong is traveling to the next platform we hear a crowd with voices swelling<br>
<br> when the ball meets the paddle we hear the crowd clapping<br>
<br> when the paddle misses the ball we hear the crowd say aww like they are sad<br>
