     <h2>An Exploration of <i>Big Money! Deluxe</i> by Pop Cap: How the creators used Sound and Social Statuses to Replicate the Fealing of Working for a Living</h2>    
  <br>With this site I will explore the symbolism created with sound and career stages that makes this game highly relatable; the theme song is an adaptation of Peter Gabriel's song <i>Big Time</i> Let's compare the real song to the animated theme song below<br>
