     <h2>An Exploration of <i>Big Money! Deluxe</i> by Pop Cap:</h2>
     <h2>How the creators used Sound and Career Status to replicate the feeling of working for a living.</h2>     
  <br>With this site I will explore the symbolism created with sound and career stages that makes this game highly relatable. The theme song is an adaptation of Peter Gabriel's song <i>Big Time</i>.<br> 
  <br>Let's compare the real song to the animated theme song below:<br>
  <br><audio controls>

</audio><br>  
  <br><audio controls>  
  <source src="horse.ogg" type="audio/ogg">
  <source src="bigtime.mp3" type="audio/mpeg">
</audio><br>
<br>The song lyrics in <i>"Big Time"</i> describes Peter struggling to financially. Dreaming of one day becoming famous and making a lot of money. Hence the perfect theme and phycological inspiration for the feeling captured by the game.</br>
<br>As you advance through stages of the game your salary increases. The game labels you with hilarious graphics to describe your growing career level starting as a "pauper".<br>

<br>The game is played by matching groups of three or more colorful coins to make them dissappear before the levels reach the top of the screen.<br>
<br>There is a stereotypical banker smoking a fat cigar who challenges you to see if you have what it takes to earn big money and advance in your career.<br>

<br>The game is fast paced, colorful, and has several different modes that allow you to play an indefinite amount of levels.<br>
<br>The nonsensical adaptations of cartoon career models are akin to the unvarnished representation of reality that connect to subconscious pictures in our mind.<br>
<br>Recalling the resemblance of people we have all encounter on the job or in life. Gameplay creating the experience of the "effet de reel' as explored in R. Barthes essay<i>The Reality Effect</i> (note1).</br>
    
<br>Who knew climbing the ladder could be this entertaining? Big Money! Deluxe mixes quirky careers and addictive sounds to make hard work feel like play. I highly recommend this game for HOURS of fun!<br>
