     <h2>An Exploration of <i>Big Money! Deluxe</i> by Pop Cap: How the creators used Sound and Social Statuses to Replicate the Fealing of Working for a Living</h2>    
  <br>With this site I will explore the symbolism created with sound and career stages that makes this game highly relatable; the theme song is an adaptation of Peter Gabriel's song <i>Big Time</i> Let's compare the real song to the animated theme song below<br>
  <br><audio controls>
  <source src="horse.ogg" type="audio/ogg">
  <source src="BGmoney.mp3" type="audio/mpeg">
</audio><br>  
  <br><audio controls>  
  <source src="horse.ogg" type="audio/ogg">
  <source src="bigtime.mp3" type="audio/mpeg">
</audio><br>
<br>The song lyrics in <i>"Big Time"</i> describes Peter struggling to financially. Dreaming of one day becoming famous and making a lot of money. Hence the perfect theme and phycological inspiration for the feeling captured by the game</br>
<br>As you advance through stages of the game your salary increases. The game labels you with hilarious graphics to describe your growing career level starting as a minimum wage worker LOL<br>

<br>The game is played by matching groups of three or more colorful coins to make them dissappear before the levels reach the top of the screen. There is a stereotypical banker smoking a fat cigar who challenges you to see if you have what it takes to earn big money and advance in your career<br>
<br>The game is fast paced, colorful, and has several different modes that allow you to play an indefinite amount of levels<br>
<br>The nonsensical adaptations of cartoon career models are akin to the unvarnished representation of reality that connect to subconscious pictures in our mind bearing a striking resemblance to real individuals we all encounter on the job or in life. Thus making the gaming experience an "effet de reel' as we explored in Barthes essay<br>
<br>I have spent HOURS playing the game over the years and each session I seam to discover a new character worker that keeps me laughing my head off and imagining the people in real life that I have seen that match the cartoon graphics.<br>
